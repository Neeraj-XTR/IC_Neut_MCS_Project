# IC_Neut_MCS_Project
Using Neutrinos monte carlo simulation to enhance the neutrino detection efficiency and reconstruction resolution relative to DeepCore, as well as lowering the energy threshold to provide sensitivity to O(1 GeV) neutrinos. Improved detector and ice calibration will enhance the performance of the entire IceCube array.
